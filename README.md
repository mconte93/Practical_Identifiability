This repository is organized as follows.

 - "Data" folder contains the original scans used for the GBM and Breast cancer cases.
   
 - "MLE_LTK" folder contains the codes used for the results obtained with the LTK model. It is divided into 6 subfolders: AA study, RA study, RR GBM study, RR Breast study, noise study, and smoothing study. Each of them contains data and codes to replicate the results shown in the paper.

 - "MLE_PM", "MLE_TK", "MLE_ETK", and "MLE_mLTK" folders contain the codes used for the results obtained with the PM, TK, ETK, and mLTK models, respectively. Each of them is divided into 4 subfolders for AA study, RA study, RR GBM study, and RR Breast study, and they contain data and codes to replicate the results shown in the supplementary material of the paper.
